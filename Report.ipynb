    "The dataset used is a subset of the **Caltech 256 Image Dataset**, originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/caltech256/data). While the full dataset includes 257 object categories and a total of 30,607 images, for this project, we have selected 100 categories from the Caltech 256 dataset and added 6 custom object categories. Each category contains approximately 100 images. And in total we have 11,520 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset features a broad range of categories, including everyday objects and more unusual items, such as backpacks, bulldozers, rubber ducks, fried eggs, and diamond rings. These objects vary in size and appearance, providing a rich and diverse collection for training and evaluating models.\n",

    "#### Siamese Neural Network\n",
    "A **Siamese Neural Network** is a special type of neural network architecture designed to compare pairs of images. It learns to identify the similarities or differences between the inputs by training on labeled pairs of images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our idea was to create a Siamese network that learns to classify pairs of images as belonging to the same class (label 1.0) or from different classes (label 0.0). This process involved the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/siamese_outputs/siamese_network_diagram.png\" alt=\"Siamese network diagram\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Siamese Model Architecture** consisted of two identical base networks that share weights. The two input images were processed independently through these base networks, and the output embeddings were compared using an L2 distance metric. The model predicted the distance between the embeddings, which is then used to determine whether the images are similar or not.\n",
    "2. **Base Network for Feature Extraction** was designed to extract relevant features from images and generate a 128-dimensional feature vector for each image. After training the Siamese network, we extracted the base model and used its output to create embeddings for new images.\n",
    "3. **Contrastive Loss Function** was implemented to train the Siamese network, that aimed to encourage the network to output samller distances for similar pairs.\n",
    "4. **Custom Accuracy Metric**, since the network outputs distance values, we introduced a custom accuracy function. This function assumes a threshold and converts the output distances into binary values (0 or 1) based on whether they are smaller or larger than the threshold, respectively. This allows the model's predictions to be evaluated in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "5. **Comparison and Similarity**. After training the model, we extrected the base model to obtain embeddings for the database images and predict embeddings for the query image. After obtaining the embeddings, the cosine distance between the two feature vectors was computed to measure their similarity. The top k most similar images were selected based on this distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the model showed promising results, the model's performance was unstable and did not meet our expectations. Possibly due to inadequate data and model overfitting.\n",

    "A **Triplet Loss**-based Contrastive Neural Network is an architecture designed to minimize the distance between similar images while maximizing the distance between different ones. We hypothesized that contrasting negative examples from different categories with positive examples from the same category would help optimize the embedding space, ensuring similar images cluster together. This process followed the architecture outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/triplet_outputs/triplet_network_diagram.png\" alt=\"Triplet network diagram\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Triplet Loss Based Contrastive Model Architecture**: The model takes triplets of images as input—an Anchor, to which distances are optimized; a Positive Example, which should be close in the embedding space; and a Negative Example, which should be distant from the anchor. A chosen Feature Extractor then generates an embedding vector for each image. The model outputs these embeddings while minimizing triplet loss.\n",
    "2. **Base Netwrok for Feature Extraction**: The triplet loss-based contrastive model alone is not capable of creating a well-structured embedding space; rather, it is better suited for refining embeddings obtained from a feature extractor. Because of this, we experimented with various base networks. We tested optimizing only the embeddings of ResNet50, retraining the entire ResNet model on our dataset with a small learning rate, fine-tuning a custom classification model, and even training a custom feature extractor from scratch.\n",
    "3. **Triplet Loss Function**: This function was implemented to train and optimize the network, aiming to refine the normalized embedding space.\n",
    "4. **Comparison and Similarity**: The trained feature extraction model was saved and later used to generate embeddings for new images. The similarity between images was then measured based on their embedding distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the approach seemed promising, the model did not perform as expected. It tended to cluster all embeddings too closely together. Although in some cases the results improved, in most scenarios, this led to a high number of false positives. Additionally it seemed to focus to hardly on the color space of the images, leading to some questionable choices for images with white background\n",

    "#### Classification Convolutional Neural Network \n",
    "\n",
    "We developed a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** designed specifically to classify images into 106 distinct categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/classification_outputs/classification_network_diagram.png\" alt=\"CNN diagram\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach consisted of steps:\n",
    "1. **Train and Validation Split** The dataset was divided into training and validation sets to facilitate the training process. Since the test data will be provided separately for querying the application, we excluded a test split during this stage. For each class (corresponding to a folder), 90% of the images were used for training, and 10% were allocated for validation. At this point each image was assigned a label derived from the folder name (e.g., `001`, `002`, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Data Generator**, a custom data generator was implemented to preprocess images during training. This generator handled the following tasks:\n",
    "   - **Loading and Normalization**: Images were read and normalized to have pixel values in the desired range.\n",
    "   - **Resizing**: Images were resized by cropping instead of stretching to preserve the original aspect ratio.  \n",
    "   - **Augmentation**: Gaussian blur was applied to enhance robustness to noise.  \n",
    "   - **Batch Generation**: The generator returned batches of preprocessed images and their corresponding one-hot encoded labels. Shuffling was applied at the end of each epoch to ensure randomness and reduce overfitting. \n",
    "3. **Classification CNN Model**, the CNN model was designed to extract features and classify images into their respective categories. The architecture consisted of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The final output layer used a **softmax activation** to produce a probability distribution over the 106 categories.  \n",
    "4. **Embedding Model Extraction**, to facilitate similarity-based querying, we extracted the second-to-last layer of the trained classification model. This layer produced a **512-dimensional feature vector** (embedding) for each image.\n",
    "5. **Similarity Computation**, once embeddings were generated, we used them for similarity-based image retrieval.  \n",
    "   - For a given query image, its embedding was predicted using the embedding model.  \n",
    "   - **Cosine similarity** was computed between the query embedding and all database embeddings.  \n",
    "   - The top-`k` most similar images were identified and returned based on the similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach achieved satisfactory performance, with the CNN producing accurate classifications in most cases. When used for similarity-based image retrieval, the results were generally very reliable. The retrieved images often belonged to the same category as the query, and even in cases where they did not, the retrieved images were visually similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few example outputs demonstrating the results:\n",
